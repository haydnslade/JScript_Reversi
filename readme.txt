I utilized JSON to create a base list of High Scores for my game.
The end goal I think would be to use localStorage, and if there is no data read in the defaults and store them.

The file is data/defaultScores.json

I also thought about creating the how to play instructions using this method. However this seems like
a lot of work, when setting up PHP or similar could easily read from a DB or DB file and that would still
be easy to modify. Due to the complexity and sillyness and bad design I did not go with this approach.
