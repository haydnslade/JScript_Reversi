            <h2>Game Logic Progress</h2>
            <h3>Primary Components</h3>
            <b>Game Grid</b>
            <p>The game grid has been partially developed, the ability to add new game pieces has been completed
                and the main items remaining to implement are the validation functions that ensure a piece placement is validation
                as well as the ability to convert opposing player's pieces when a new piece is placed.
            </p>
            <b>Game State</b>
            <p>The game state has been completed and currently keeps track of the current player. The only other item that may end up
                being implemented in the state is the number of remaining discs.
            </p>
            <b>Game Session</b>
            <p>The game session info is admittedly slapped together to work with the current input options. This should most likely be
                moved to the model (as I am currently breaking the MVC model at the moment.)
            </p>
            <b>Other items</b>
            <p>Perhaps not particularly part of the game logic, I think that my View and Controller are tied together pretty tightly.
                I would like to spend more time trying to separate them. Eventually I would like to implement multiple color schemes as well.
            </p>
            <h2>Testing Game Logic</h2>
            <b>Game Grid</b>
            <p>The current functionality of the game grid can be tested by simply clicking empty squares on the game board.</p>
            <b>Game State</b>
            <p>When a new piece is placed on the board as above, the current player is modified.</p>
            <b>Game Session</b>
            <p>If you enter a new name for player one or two, the current player will accurately reflect that name.</p>
